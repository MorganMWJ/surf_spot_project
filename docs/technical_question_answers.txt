1)

I spent 3 days working on the project. I had to revise android and I wrote the MainActivty
class in kotlin which I had not used previously. If not for the time spent learning I think
I would have achieved more in that time. The motivation for using Kotlin was to get familar
with the language as recomended.

I would implement the following changes to my solution:
	-A slider enabling the user to change km radius of search distance.
	-Input for the user to change search key from 'lodging'.
	-I would parse more of the JSON attributes provided by the Places API for display to the user.
		-Address
		-Telephone number
		-Photos
	-I would implement the optional map fucntionality
	-I would like a better UI, perhaps looking into learning material design or similar.
	-I would put the user inputs in a menu drawer so they always take up a large part of the screen.

I used retrofit for a REST client with GSON for a JSON deserialiser. 
The two were new to me but worked well together. The most useful thing I found
was being able to search premade vector graphics in Android Studio. I could quickly
select a simple button icon/image without having to download one or make my own.
